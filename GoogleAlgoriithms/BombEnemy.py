Problem Description
You are given an m x n matrix grid where each cell contains one of three possible values:

'W' represents a wall
'E' represents an enemy
'0' represents an empty cell
Your task is to find the maximum number of enemies you can kill by placing exactly one bomb in the grid.


Rules for bomb placement and explosion:

A bomb can only be placed in an empty cell (marked as '0')
When a bomb explodes, it kills all enemies in the same row and column as the bomb
The explosion extends in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the bomb's position
The explosion stops when it hits a wall ('W') in any direction - walls block the explosion from continuing further
Walls cannot be destroyed by the explosion
